My path to cyber is fun and frustrating at the same time, so hereâ€™s a quick storyâ€¦ One day, I decided I wanted more out of my IT career and asked a cyber buddy where I should begin. He suggested that I apply myself in a home-built lab and obtain my Security+ certification, so I did just that. I first purchased a Security+ course on a major online learning platform and began studying. As I watched the Security+ course, I glanced at the page source to find the current videoâ€™s MP4 file exposed. I then force-browsed my way to the Security+ courseâ€™s root video directory, giving me access to all the Security+ courseâ€™s MP4 filesâ€¦ Big deal, right? I had paid for access. Well, after confirming this learning platform was part of a bug bounty program and that this discovery was in-scope, I wandered my way to a random unpaid-for course and found the directory structure by force-browsing from the courseâ€™s preview video URL. This ultimately led to the discovery of all the MP4 videos of the unpaid-for course! Did my intuition lead me to my first bug!? With the lack of experience I had, I was having a hard time believing the situation, so I confirmed the issue by looking over a few other courses, verifying the problem over and over. Despite my lack of experience with bug reporting, the report I submitted was effective. After few days passed, I revisited and verified that the issue had been fixed, later receiving a reply stating that no issues were found. ðŸ˜¡ Even though I was upset, I learned two important things that day: I found my passion in cybersecurity and it stems from the idea of helping others protect their data. Making clear, concise, and detailed reports is a very important! Anyways, why this blog? Provide a resource for others. ðŸ˜ƒ Showcase my knowledge to employers. ðŸ˜‰ Now go dig around!
