Hello world!

``` bash

I’m a born computer nerd who’s trying to figure out how everything works. My path to cyber is fun and frustrating at the same time, so here’s a quick story…

One day, I decided I wanted more out of my IT career and asked a cyber buddy where I should begin. He suggested that I apply myself in a home-built lab and obtain my Security+ certification, so I did just that. I started by purchasing a Security+ course on a major online learning platform and began studying.

As I watched the Security+ course, I glanced at the page source to find the current video’s MP4 file exposed. I then force-browsed my way to the Security+ course’s root video directory, giving me access to all the Security+ course’s MP4 files… Big deal, right? I had paid for access. Well, after confirming this learning platform was part of a bug bounty program and that this discovery was in-scope, I wandered my way to a random unpaid-for course and found the directory structure by force-browsing from the course’s sample video URL. This ultimately led to the discovery of all the MP4 videos of the unpaid-for course! Did my intuition lead me to my first bug!? With the lack of experience I had, I was having a hard time believing the situation, so I confirmed the issue by looking over a few other courses, verifying the problem over and over.

Despite my lack of experience with bug reporting, the report I submitted was effective. After a few days passed, I revisited the learning platform and verified that the issue had been fixed, while later receiving a reply on the bug bounty platform stating that no issues were found.

Even though I was upset for not getting the recognition, I came out on top by learning two important things that day:

1. I found my passion in cybersecurity, stemming from the idea of helping others protect their data.
2. Making clear, concise, and detailed reports is very important!

Anyways, why this blog?
 1. Provide a resource for others. :smiley:  
 2. Showcase my knowledge to employers. :wink:    

&emsp;

Now, go dig around!
